Command line tools for cs3110.
The solution for compiling, testing, and running your code. 
Commands are:
* `cs3110 compile <filename>` compile the target file, generating corresponding `.cmo` and `.cmi` files

* [OCaml 4.01.0](http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html)
* [OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/)
* [pa_ounit](https://github.com/janestreet/pa_ounit)
* [oUnit](https://github.com/warrenharris/ounit)

Instructions for installing these packages coming soon.

Installation
============

Download the script and the dependencies.
Execute `make`.
This creates the `cs3110` executable.

You can call this executable with the absolute path, create a symlink with `make link`, or extend your `PATH` to include the containing directory. 

Removal
=======

Run `make uninstall`.
This removes the `cs3110` executable and all the library files for the supporting `assertions.ml`.
You may delete the directory too, but that's arguably overkill.

If you ran `make link` earlier, `make unlink` will remove that symbolic link.
If you modified your path earlier, you should delete that portion of your shell init file. 

FAQ
===

Q. How do I set a timeout on a test?
------------------------------------

Use `Assertions.timeout`, from the `Assertions` library, which is linked to every executable generated by `cs3110 compile`.
This function is documented in `assertions.mli`.

Q. How do I set a timeout on the entire harness?
------------------------------------------------

There is no functionality to do this.
Try the GNU [timeout](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#timeout-invocation) command.
